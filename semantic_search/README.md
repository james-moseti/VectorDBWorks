# Semantic Search with Pinecone & Sentence Transformers

![Semantic Search](https://img.shields.io/badge/Semantic_Search-Pinecone-blue.svg)  
## Overview
This project implements a **Semantic Search** system using a Quora dataset, text embeddings, and Pinecone as a vector database. The goal is to find semantically similar questions based on user queries.

## How It Works
1. **Dataset Preparation**: The Quora dataset is used to extract questions and generate embeddings.
2. **Vectorization**: Each question is transformed into an embedding representation using a machine learning model.
3. **Storage & Indexing**: The embeddings are stored in **Pinecone**, a vector database optimized for similarity search.
4. **User Query**: A user enters a search query.
5. **Retrieval**: The system finds semantically similar questions from the dataset.
6. **Results**: The most relevant questions are returned to the user.

## Features
✔ **Fast and Scalable**: Uses Pinecone’s **serverless** vector search  
✔ **Supports Large Datasets**: Handles millions of vectors efficiently  
✔ **Customizable Embeddings**: Compatible with **OpenAI, DeepSeek, BERT, and more**  
✔ **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes large datasets with **batch inserts**  
✔ **Easy API Integration**: Can be integrated into **AI chatbots, recommendation engines, or NLP applications**

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pinecone** (Vector Database)
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch** (For embeddings)
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (For text encoding)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (For experimentation)
